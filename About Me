# About Me

Hi, I’m **Ayla Rose**. I’m transitioning into tech with a focus on **Cybersecurity and IT**, not out of hype or idealism, but because it’s a field that aligns well with how I think, learn, and solve problems.

I’m highly analytical, pick up technical systems quickly, and work well with complex, rule-based environments. I’m drawn to roles that involve troubleshooting, investigating issues, working with operating systems, and understanding how digital systems behave under real conditions.

My background includes experience in fast-paced, operational roles where I developed strong skills in problem-solving, communication, time management, and working with technology-driven workflows. Those skills translate directly into IT and security work, especially in support, monitoring, and operations-focused roles.

## Technical Focus

- Linux systems and command-line tools  
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/UDP)  
- Log analysis and system troubleshooting  
- Operating system fundamentals  
- Security concepts and controls  
- Basic automation with Python and Bash  

I approach cybersecurity as a **practical technical discipline**: learning the tools, understanding the systems, and applying structured thinking to real problems. I’m less interested in buzzwords and more interested in building concrete, usable skills.

## Current Work

- Hands-on labs (TryHackMe, Hack The Box, Google Cybersecurity Labs)  
- Terminal-based Linux practice (files, permissions, processes, logs)  
- Learning Python and Bash for automation and workflow efficiency  
- Studying networking and operating systems  

## Goals

- Move into an entry-level technical role (SOC Analyst, IT Support, Security Operations)  
- Build strong operational and troubleshooting skills  
- Develop a portfolio of practical technical projects  
- Continue progressing into stable, well-compensated technical roles
